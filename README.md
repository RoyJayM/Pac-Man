# Pac-Man
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>Open html.index file</p>
<p>Here's how the game is played:
<img src="images/PacMan1.png" width="300" style="max-width: 100%;">

When you click the "Create PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Increase Pace" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.<p>

<h1>Future Improvements</h1>
<p>-Make each Pacman move and bounce off any wall it hits.</p>
<p>-Change Pacman mouth and facial direction based on its movement.</br>
